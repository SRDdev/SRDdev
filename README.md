## About Me

I am an **AI Systems Engineer and Researcher** specializing in the intersection of **Applied Research** and **Production Infrastructure**. My work focuses on architecting **State-Aware Agentic Workflows**, **Real-Time Perception Pipelines**, and **AI Safety Mechanisms**.

I bridge the gap between "State-of-the-Art" and "Scale," building systems that are not only novel but robust and deployable. Currently, I am a Researcher at the **[AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC)](https://aiisc.ai/)**, developing forensic integrity layers (Watermarking, Hallucination Mitigation) for Generative AI. Simultaneously, as an **AI Systems Engineer** at **Techolution**, I lead the development of Embodied AI systems that achieve **97% task accuracy** and **2mm precision** in dynamic environments.

## Research & Mentorship

My research on "Safety-by-Design" architectures is conducted under the guidance of **[Dr. Amitava Das](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HYpfhaEAAAAJ)** (BITS Pilani/AIISC). I am fortunate to be mentored by and collaborate with leading scientists including **[Vasu Sharma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9z2bP28AAAAJ)** (Meta AI/FAIR), **[Aman Chadha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0yKk9CkAAAAJ)** (Apple/Stanford AI), and **[Vinija Jain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9z2bP28AAAAJ)** (Meta/Amazon).
